# Mojangles-3DS
The Mojangles font brought to the 3DS!
This is a custom font that fully replaces the original font used for the 3DS. This font, when installed, will appear in system apps, some homebrew, and even some games. 

## Warning: DO NOT UNINSTALL CFW WITH A CUSTOM FONT! YOU WILL BRICK YOUR 3DS!
If you wish to uninstall CFW, restore the system font using [this guide](https://aromakitsune.github.io/3DS-Custom-System-Fonts#restoring-the-system-font).

**How to Install:**
Follow [this Guide](https://aromakitsune.github.io/3DS-Custom-System-Fonts#installing-the-custom-system-font) to install custom fonts.

**Please Note:**
Custom fonts are not perfect and are incompatible with some apps. An example of this is garbled text in CTRPF plugins. Additionally, text that is usually one line may appear as two lines, and the text size may vary. This is likely due to the weird properties of the font as mojangles is made really weird. Currently there is no known fix.
